# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Environment Setup

`amos` uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage its environment. After
cloning the repository, install every dependency (including the optional
packages that the tests use) and the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
uv sync
uv run pre-commit install
```

Then run the tests, the linter, and the type checker:

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check
uv run mypy
```

## Development

Follow this basic process:

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-or-bugfix-name`.
3. Edit the code.
4. If you added functionality or features, update the documentation accordingly.

If you are unsure about how to fix or ignore a warning, just let the continuous
integration fail, and we will help you during review.

Don't bother updating the changelog, we will take care of this.

## Adding a technique

Most contributions to `amos` are new techniques. To add one:

1. Find the module of its genre (`cleaners`, `describers`, `splitters`,
   `transformers`, `samplers`, `models`, `metrics`, `evaluators`, or `plots`)
   and copy a similar technique. Every class is a `dataclasses.dataclass`.
2. Wrap tools from other packages by their import paths (in `contents` or
   `tools`), not by importing them at the top of a module. They are imported
   only when the technique is used, so `amos` stays light and its optional
   packages stay optional. If the tool comes from a new package, add the
   package to an extra in `pyproject.toml` and to `options._EXTRAS`.
3. Give the class a docstring whose first line describes the technique. The
   technique catalog in `docs/advanced.md` uses it, and a unit test checks that
   every technique is in the catalog.
4. Make sure the technique learns only from the training rows, records what
   it did in the dataset's `history`, and uses the dataset's `seed` for
   anything random.
5. Add tests. Tests that use an optional package call `requires` (in
   `tests/conftest.py`) so that they are skipped where the package cannot be
   imported.

Examples in the README and the documentation are run by `tests/test_docs.py`.
The comment lines after a `print` statement are its expected output.

The figures in the README are drawn by the breast cancer study in the README
itself. If that study changes, draw them again (they are saved in `docs/img`):

```bash
uv run python docs/scripts/readme_figures.py
```

## Pull requests guidelines

Link to any related issue in the Pull Request message.

During the review, we recommend using fixups:

```bash
# SHA is the SHA of the commit you want to fix
git commit --fixup=SHA
```

Once all the changes are approved, you can squash your commits:

```bash
git rebase -i --autosquash main
```

And force-push:

```bash
git push -f
```

If this seems all too complicated, you can push or force-push each new commit,
and we will squash them ourselves if needed, before merging.

## Style Guidelines

This package follows the [Google
Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) with two
notable exceptions:

1. It always adds spaces around "=". This not only violates the Google guide, it
   violates [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), the foundational Python
   style guide from which all other resources are derived. I defy this strong,
   long-standing norm because I find it more readable. My brain and eyes have
   trouble seeing two separate objects when an equal sign is in the middle. I
   imagine that I am not alone in this accessibility issue. Further, as PEP8
   itself notes, required spaces around equal signs are becoming increasing
   common with type annotations becoming part of best practices (and, as a
   result, signatures to classes, functions, and methods regularly include
   spaces around the equal signs). I realize that this will seem alien to many
   coders, but it is far easier on my eyes.
2. I use some so-called "power features", primarily dunder methods, to make my
   interfaces easier to access and use. This is disfavored in the Google Python
   Style Guide because such code is often more difficult for others to read. To
   address that concern, I try to document and comment as to what the code is
   doing whenever I used any of the "power features" of Python.

Because of the first exception, the project does not use a code formatter (such
as `ruff format`), which would remove those spaces.
